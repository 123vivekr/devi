Project Name: Terminal Snake Game

Current Focus: Developing a snake game playable in the terminal.

Plan:
- [ ] Step 1: Research Python libraries for terminal-based user interface (UI) development.
- [ ] Step 2: Choose a suitable library for terminal UI, considering factors like ease of use and compatibility with snake game requirements.
- [ ] Step 3: Design the game logic, including snake movement, food spawning, collision detection, and score tracking.
- [ ] Step 4: Implement the core game logic in Python, focusing on text-based interface interactions.
- [ ] Step 5: Test the game logic thoroughly to ensure proper functionality and handling of edge cases.
- [ ] Step 6: Refine the user interface for better clarity and user experience, if necessary.
- [ ] Step 7: Test the game in various terminal environments to ensure compatibility and performance.
- [ ] Step 8: Document the code and provide instructions for playing the game in the terminal.
- [ ] Step 9: Finalize the project structure and prepare for distribution or sharing, if applicable.

Summary: This plan outlines the steps to create a snake game playable in the terminal using Python. It involves researching and selecting a suitable library for terminal UI, implementing the game logic, testing for functionality and compatibility, and finally, documenting the project for distribution or sharing. The key considerations include choosing the right library for terminal UI and ensuring thorough testing across different terminal environments.
